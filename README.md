- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheSpaceMoth
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a C, C++ and C# programmer by trade, now also working with XML and C# for Rimworld mods! Most if not all my repositories here are going to be Rimworld mod backups for reupload should I or Steam explode, or to allow others to peek in and understand how the mods work!
- ðŸ“« If you want to reach me, contact me on Discord at SpaceMoth#3825
